# GIANT
## Problem
Intrusion Analysts are wasting their time going between browsers, urls, and terminals to run different types of applications.

## Solution
GIANT (Goliath, Intrusion Analyst Network Toolkit) seeks to remove those issues. The analyst will have access to a Web GUI along with a command line application for the analysts that want to be a little closer to their data.

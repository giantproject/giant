# GIANT
## Problem
Intrusion Analysts are wasting their time going between browsers, urls, and terminals to run different types of applications.

## Solution
GIANT (Goliath, Intrusion Analyst Network Toolkit) seeks to remove those issues. The analyst will have access to a Web GUI along with a command line application for the analysts that want to be a little closer to their data.

## Development
To code against this:
- Clone the repo, github should tell you how
- type: `source venv/bin/activate` # This sets you into the virtual environment so you don't litter your system with too many packages
- `python setup.py install` should set up your environment to install everything you need.
